        <pre>
The heart is cage without a key.

Filled with rage, beating free.

Against the ribs it can not see.

A skeleton without doors or locks.

In a sea of cells - The mind, the docks. 
        </pre>
    </div>

    <div class="poem-section">
        <pre>
When the wind howls

There is a tunnel in the air.

A funnel, passage nowhere.

Through Open Jowls.

Noise erupts from curbed smiles

When the wind howls for miles.
        </pre>
    </div>

    <div class="poem-section">
        <pre>
A special order from within.

By the nerves underneath your skin.

The future hungers for bitten nails 

A fitting recipe which entails

A helping of respite

Compelling you to bite
        </pre>
    </div>

    <div class="poem-section">
        <pre>
A moment in-between your breath

When lungs enjoy an empty bath

The mind wanders a narrow path

To a subtle pace of life and death
        </pre>
    </div>

    <div class="poem-section">
        <pre>
Every day you drift into the sea.

Walking a path without a name.

The roads will never be the same.

Save from slumber...your dreams return thee.
        </pre>
    </div>

    <div class="poem-section">
        <pre>
You live in static lands

Covered by the clouds of a memory

Which rains upon your precious dome

Passing through trickling sands

to place where you're meant to be:

The dewdrops of home.
        </pre>
    </div>

    <div class="poem-section">
        <pre>
Liquidation of trust

Is an act so vile.

Dumping precious pearls.

Painting roses with bile.

The smell makes your stomach flip

Every time you take a sip.

Drink we all must

From the wells of trust.
        </pre>
    </div>

    <div class="poem-section">
        <pre>
Smoke in a mirror

Spoke before your eyes

The image is not clearer

The visage is unwise.

Look into the void

Where stars and comets collide.

There's no need to be paranoid

About what's inside.

Without a heart

You're a bucket of tin

In every part,

The Ghost within.
        </pre>
    </div>

    <div class="poem-section">
        <pre>
A modest sunrise

tugs on my heartstrings.

A melody rings

to open my eyes.

The world rumbles

And falls down.

a building crumbles

Upon my fragile crown.

Reeling from the river's wake

The edges of my form break

Revealing liquid chrome

Shining in the sun

The day has just begun

With a strong feeling of home.
        </pre>
    </div>

    <div class="poem-section">
        <pre>
A dandelion in the sky

Floats high

Eye sharper than a telescope

Spots my invitation so dope

A black rose swoops upon the trellis

To dwell where the food is
        </pre>
    </div>

    <div class="poem-section">
        <pre>
Like glass on the shadows from a shimmering lake

Like a slow heartbeat in the bodies of dreamers

Arms of the sun extend toward the plants

To share brilliant grace

with outer space
        </pre>
    </div>

    <div class="poem-section">
        <pre>
Pull upon the coils

Of a well taught mind

For a wealth of knowledge to tap.

Tension you will find

Towards a natural state of recoil.

Snap.

    </div>

    <div class="poem-section">
        <pre>
Inside your skull

Is a lullabye

to let memories go.

So all you know

Could be a secret

You would forget.
        </pre>
    </div>

    <div class="poem-section">
        <pre>
The setting sun is chasing you.

Your shadow runs but sticks like glue.

Darkness captures everyone.

Worldwide rapture by the setting sun.

    </div>

    <div class="poem-section">
        <pre>
Footsteps in the attic

Shuffling in the walls

Scampering down empty halls

The rats are frantic

Chew dramatic

Never there when duty calls
        </pre>
    </div>

    <div class="poem-section">
        <pre>
Quenched thirst

On the Horizon

Of the imagination

a fate cursed

Camoflauged

Your first mirage
        </pre>
    </div>

    <div class="poem-section">
        <pre>
It's the end of all you know

Before your eyes you'll see a glow

A shining light before thee

The throes of death

One last rhyme.

Just save your breath

One more time.
        </pre>

Ghosts in the machine

Are exercised with ratchets

When you fix a car

    <div class="poem-section">
        <pre>
Our body is a device to hold the energy of our soul

With all the bells and whistles for vice.

The matter we stole, the burden we bear.

Electricity everywhere.

Status: unknown.

Course shown:

Marked for removal.

All alone...

One condition for approval:

Repay thoughts on loan,

Sourced from your phone.

    </div>

    <div class="poem-section">
        <pre>
Cruelty is real.

Footstep on daisy.

Spinning Wheel.

Money like crazy.

The world is slow

Around a moment of success

For a heart of woe;

The Steel Empress.

What is a vessel?

A container of you.

A typical fool

without a clue

Until your soul is full

From the tears you brew.
        </pre>
    </div>

    <div class="poem-section">
        <pre>
A paper plane upon a gust of air

Gracefully descends from there

The sky from which your spirit wished

To fly again, your work unfinished.

    </div>

    <div class="poem-section">
        <pre>
A shadow wraps a broken heart

Around the edge to pull apart

A wound which never fully healed.

Within, the darkness is revealed.
        </pre>
    </div>

    <div class="poem-section">
        <pre>
The sight of hunger knows you best.

Without thinking, you eat...

and the soul is composed once again.
        </pre>
    </div>

    <div class="poem-section">
        <pre>
Mix a spirit

With some spice.

Duel a slice of fruit and spear it.

Serve a soul on ice.

Cool.

    </div>

    <div class="poem-section">
        <pre>
The scent of pines

and unpaved roads,

Slivers in your eye.

Croaking toads

And hallowed signs

Send shivers down your spine.
        </pre>
    </div>

    <div class="poem-section">
        <pre>
Intoxication, incomplete

Infoxication, obsolete.

Believe me, in theory

All the things you'll ever be.

Around them, your memories.

Within them the spirit breeze.

Fickle poets search for

A space where characters wait in store.

The typewriter of yore, commonplace from before.

Flexible survivor from a C: war. 

With a clean slate, hot silver tray,

Make sure settings say,

"Cease evermore the writing phase."

"Save the battery, always."
        </pre>
    </div>

    <div class="poem-section">
        <pre>
Letters engraved lay bare

On a pillar of limestone...

Before a thousand-yard stare,

Put to a windy grindstone.

Another day saved by commonsense.

Sitting on a fence

Putting indifference.
